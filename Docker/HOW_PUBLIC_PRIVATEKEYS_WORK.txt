Public and private keys are essential components of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol used for secure communication between systems, such as logging into an EC2 instance on AWS. Here's a step-by-step flow to understand how the keys work on an EC2 server:

1. Key Pair Creation
Generate Key Pair: When you create an EC2 instance, AWS allows you to generate or provide an SSH key pair. This consists of two keys:
Public Key: This key is shared and is stored on the EC2 server.
Private Key: This key is kept on the client machine (local machine) and must be kept secret.
2. Uploading the Public Key
During the EC2 instance creation, AWS uses the public key to configure the EC2 instance. The public key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the ec2-user (or the default user of the EC2 instance).
This allows the server to recognize and authenticate incoming connections from clients that possess the corresponding private key.
3. Private Key on the Client Side
The private key remains securely stored on your local machine (client). It should be protected with strict permissions and not shared.
When you attempt to SSH into the EC2 instance, the SSH client uses the private key to prove your identity to the server.
4. SSH Connection Attempt
You initiate an SSH connection from the local machine to the EC2 instance using the ssh command (e.g., ssh -i /path/to/private-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-ip-address).
The SSH client attempts to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key and the username (e.g., ec2-user).
5. Public Key Authentication
Once the SSH connection request is received, the EC2 instance uses the public key (from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) to verify the authenticity of the connection.
The server sends a challenge (usually a random number or nonce) to the client.
The client uses its private key to sign this challenge. The signature is then sent back to the server.
6. Server Validation
The server checks the signed challenge using the stored public key. If the signature matches, it proves that the client holds the correct private key.
If the validation is successful, the server allows the connection to proceed.
7. Secure Communication Established
Once authenticated, the SSH session is established. Communication between the client and the server is encrypted using symmetric encryption, with keys exchanged using a secure handshake mechanism.
The client can now securely execute commands on the EC2 instance or transfer files.
Key Points:
Public Key: Stored on the EC2 instance to allow authentication.
Private Key: Stored on the local machine, used to sign authentication challenges.
One-way Authentication: Only the client with the private key can authenticate, and the server uses the public key to verify the identity.
Flow Recap:
Generate a key pair (public and private).
Store the public key on the EC2 instance.
Store the private key on your local machine.
SSH into EC2 using the private key.
EC2 authenticates using the public key stored on the instance.
Once authenticated, the SSH connection is established securely.
This mechanism ensures that only users with the correct private key can access the EC2 instance, providing secure, password-less authentication.
