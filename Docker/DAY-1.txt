The DevOps  is a continuous process that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.
 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle:
1. Plan
Involves defining requirements, project goals, and workflows.
Tools: Jira, Trello, Confluence, GitLab (issues/planning boards).
2. Develop
Writing, reviewing, and managing code.
Continuous integration (CI) ensures code changes are merged into the main branch and tested frequently.
Tools: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, VS Code.
3. Build
Compiling source code into executable artifacts.
Automated builds and dependency management ensure consistent results.
Tools: Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, Azure DevOps.
4. Test
Automated and manual testing to ensure functionality, performance, and security.
Continuous testing catches bugs early in the development cycle.
Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Postman.
5. Release
Preparing the software for deployment by packaging it into containers or executables.
Tools for managing version control, tagging releases, and change approval processes are used.
Tools: GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, Jenkins.
6. Deploy
Automatically or manually deploying the application to production or staging environments.
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools and container orchestration streamline deployments.
Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CodeDeploy, Ansible.
7. Operate
Monitoring and managing application performance, infrastructure, and uptime.
Logging, alerting, and proactive issue detection ensure reliability.
Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Nagios.
8. Monitor
Continuous feedback loops using monitoring, analytics, and user feedback.
Observability provides actionable insights for improvement.
Tools: New Relic, Datadog, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
==================================
A cron job is a scheduled task in Unix-based systems that runs automatically at specified intervals using the cron daemon. It is defined in a file called the crontab (cron table), where users specify the command or script to execute, along with the schedule.

Purpose:
Cron jobs are used for automating repetitive tasks such as:

Backing up files and databases.
Running maintenance scripts.
Monitoring system health.
Sending periodic reports or emails.
Cleaning up temporary files.
