========================================================================
In shell scripts, we write #!/bin/bash (called a shebang) at the beginning to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.

Why do we write #!/bin/bash in scripts?
Specifies the Shell Interpreter:

The shebang (#!) tells the operating system to use /bin/bash as the interpreter for the script.
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
Ensures Compatibility:

Some systems have multiple shells (sh, bash, zsh, dash).
Writing #!/bin/bash ensures that the script runs with Bash, which has more features than sh.
Avoids Manual Execution:

Instead of running bash script.sh, you can execute it directly:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x script.sh  # Make it executable
./script.sh         # Run it
Prevents Errors:

If the system‚Äôs default shell is not Bash (e.g., sh or dash), using #!/bin/bash ensures compatibility with Bash-specific commands like [[ ]], declare, and let.
Alternative Shebangs
#!/bin/sh ‚Üí Uses POSIX-compliant shell (more portable, fewer features).
#!/usr/bin/env bash ‚Üí Finds Bash dynamically in different environments.
Example Difference (sh vs. bash)
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/sh
echo "Bash supports [[ ]] conditionals"
if [[ "hello" == "hello" ]]; then echo "Bash only"; fi
Running this with sh gives an error because [[ ]] is Bash-specific.
Conclusion
Writing #!/bin/bash ensures that your script always runs with Bash, making it more predictable and avoiding compatibility issues. üöÄ


1. What is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It interprets commands and executes programs.

Examples of shells:

Bash (/bin/bash) ‚Üí Default in most Linux systems
Zsh (/bin/zsh) ‚Üí Advanced features over Bash
Sh (/bin/sh) ‚Üí POSIX-compliant, minimal shell
Fish (/usr/bin/fish) ‚Üí User-friendly shell
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Hello, World!"
The shell interprets echo and prints Hello, World!.

2. What is a Subshell?
A subshell is a child process created by a shell. It inherits the parent shell's environment but runs commands independently.

How is a Subshell Created?
Using parentheses ()

Commands inside parentheses run in a subshell.
Variables in the subshell do not affect the parent shell.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
VAR="Hello"
(VAR="Subshell"; echo "$VAR")  # Runs in a subshell
echo "$VAR"  # Still prints "Hello" because the subshell didn't affect the parent shell
Using bash command

Running bash starts a new subshell.
Commands executed in this new shell do not affect the parent shell.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Main shell: $$"  # Prints the main shell's PID
bash
echo "Subshell: $$"    # New PID (subshell)
exit                   # Exit back to the main shell
Using Command Substitution $(command) or Backticks `command`

Runs a command in a subshell and captures its output.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)  # 'pwd' runs in a subshell
echo "You are in $CURRENT_DIR"
Key Differences Between Shell and Subshell
Feature	Shell (Parent)	Subshell (Child)
Process ID (PID)	Same PID as user session	New PID
Variable Scope	Changes persist	Changes do not affect parent
Environment Inheritance	N/A	Inherits from the parent shell
Example Creation	Running bash or a script	Using (), $(command), bash
Practical Example: Shell vs. Subshell
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Parent Shell PID: $$"

(
    echo "Subshell PID: $$"
    VAR="Changed in subshell"
)

echo "Parent Shell VAR: $VAR"  # VAR is unchanged
Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Parent Shell PID: 12345
Subshell PID: 67890
Parent Shell VAR:   # Empty, as subshell changes do not affect parent
Conclusion
A shell is the main command-line interface.
A subshell is a separate process created by the shell.
Changes made inside a subshell do not affect the parent shell.
Useful for running isolated commands without affecting the main environment. üöÄ


1. What is a Kernel?
The kernel is the core component of an operating system (OS) that manages hardware and software interactions. It acts as a bridge between user applications and the system‚Äôs hardware.

2. Functions of a Kernel
The kernel is responsible for several key functions:

Function	Description
Process Management	Creates, schedules, and terminates processes.
Memory Management	Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.
File System Management	Manages files and directories on storage.
Device Management	Communicates with hardware using drivers.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC)	Allows processes to communicate and share data.
Security & Access Control	Enforces user permissions and security policies.
3. Types of Kernels
Kernel Type	Description
Monolithic Kernel	All OS services (memory, process, file management) run in kernel mode. Example: Linux, Unix.
Microkernel	Minimal kernel; most services run in user space for better security. Example: Minix, QNX.
Hybrid Kernel	A mix of monolithic and microkernel. Example: Windows, macOS.
Exokernel	Bare-minimum kernel that allows user programs to access hardware directly. Example: ExOS.
4. User Space vs. Kernel Space
User Space ‚Üí Where applications run (e.g., browsers, text editors).
Kernel Space ‚Üí Where the kernel operates (handling drivers, memory, and processes).
üõë Why Separation?

Prevents applications from directly accessing system resources.
Increases security and stability by restricting direct hardware access.
5. How the Kernel Works? (System Call Example)
When a program needs to access hardware (e.g., read a file), it makes a system call to the kernel.

üìå Example: Reading a file in Linux
1Ô∏è‚É£ A user program (cat file.txt) requests to read a file.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The program calls the read() system call.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The kernel checks permissions and accesses the file from the disk.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data is sent back to the user program.

üí° Common System Calls:

fork() ‚Üí Creates a new process
exec() ‚Üí Runs a new program
open() / read() / write() ‚Üí File operations
kill() ‚Üí Terminates a process
6. Difference Between Kernel and Shell
Feature	Kernel	Shell
Role	Core of the OS, manages hardware	Interface between user and kernel
Function	Process scheduling, memory, file handling	Executes user commands
Runs in	Kernel space	User space
Example	Linux Kernel, Windows NT Kernel	Bash, Zsh, PowerShell
7. Kernel in Linux (Practical Example)
üîπ Check Kernel Version:

bash
Copy
Edit
uname -r
üîπ View Kernel Messages:

bash
Copy
Edit
dmesg | less
üîπ Check System Calls:

bash
Copy
Edit
strace ls
Conclusion
The kernel is the OS's core, managing system resources.
It operates in kernel space, separate from user programs.
It provides system calls for apps to interact with hardware.
Different types include monolithic, microkernel, hybrid, and exokernel.
