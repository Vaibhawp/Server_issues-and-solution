1. Git Stash
   - Definition: `git stash` temporarily saves (or "stashes") changes in your working directory, allowing you to switch branches or work on something else without committing. The changes are saved on a stack, which you can reapply later.

   - Usage:
     bash
     git stash         # Stashes all tracked and staged changes
     git stash apply   # Reapplies the last stashed changes
     git stash pop     # Applies and removes the last stashed changes from the stash stack
     

   - Situation Example: Suppose you're working on feature A but then realize you need to fix a critical bug on the main branch. You can stash your changes on feature A, switch to the main branch to fix the bug, and then return to feature A to reapply the stashed changes.

2. Git Cherry-Pick
   - Definition: `git cherry-pick` is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It allows you to "pick" individual commits rather than merging all changes from a branch.

     git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

   - Situation Example: Imagine you have a bug fix in a feature branch that you also need in the main branch. Instead of merging the entire feature branch, you can use `git cherry-pick` to select just that bug fix commit and apply it to the main branch.


3. Git Rebase
   - Definition: `git rebase` is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving (or "rebasing") the branch’s commits on top of another base tip. This creates a linear history without merge commits.

     git rebase <branch-name>


   - Situation Example: You’re working on a feature branch, and the main branch has received some new commits since you started. Running `git rebase main` on your feature branch will reapply your commits on top of the latest changes in the main branch, making it as if your work was based on the latest version of main.

   - Note: Avoid rebasing public or shared branches as it rewrites commit history.


4. Git Pull
   - Definition: `git pull` is a command that updates your local branch with changes from the remote repository. It is effectively a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.

     git pull origin <branch-name>

   - Situation Example: You are working on a project with multiple collaborators, and they push updates to the remote repository. Running `git pull` in your local branch will bring in those updates so you are working with the latest code.

5. Git Revert
   - Definition: `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified commit. It is a safe way to undo changes because it doesn’t alter the commit history but instead applies a new "reverse" commit.

     git revert <commit-hash>

   - Situation Example: If a commit introduced a bug or unintended behavior, you can use `git revert` to create a new commit that removes the changes made by that commit without rewriting history.


Situation-Based Questions

1. Situation: You’ve been working on feature A but realize you need to address an urgent issue on the main branch. You have uncommitted changes in feature A. What would you do?
   - Solution: Use `git stash` to temporarily save your changes, switch to the main branch, address the issue, and then return to feature A. Use `git stash apply` to reapply your stashed changes.

2. Situation: A critical bug was fixed in the development branch, and you want to include that specific fix in the main branch without merging everything from development.
   - Solution: Use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` to apply only the bug-fix commit to the main branch without merging the whole development branch.

3. Situation: You and your teammate have been working on separate branches based on an outdated main branch. You both want to update your branches with the latest main branch changes while keeping a clean commit history.
   - Solution: Each of you can use `git rebase main` on your respective branches. This will apply your branch's commits on top of the latest main branch, creating a linear history.

4. Situation: You pulled changes from the remote repository and encountered merge conflicts in several files. What would you do?
   - Solution: Resolve the merge conflicts manually in each file. After fixing them, use `git add <file>` on each resolved file and then complete the merge with `git commit`.

5. Situation: A teammate accidentally merged a feature branch into the main branch, but the feature isn’t ready. How would you remove it?
   - Solution: Use `git revert` on the merge commit. This will create a new commit that undoes all changes from the feature branch merge, preserving the history.
========================================================================================================================================================================================

Practical Examples with Commands

1. Example with Git Stash:  
   You're working on a feature branch, and you've modified several files but haven’t committed your changes. Suddenly, your manager asks you to switch to another branch to test a new update.  
   - Commands:
     bash
     git stash            # Save your changes
     git checkout main    # Switch to main branch
     # Work on main branch, do testing, etc.
     git checkout feature # Switch back to your feature branch
     git stash pop        # Reapply your stashed changes
     

2. Example with Git Cherry-Pick:  
   You’ve made a small fix in a feature branch and realize it’s relevant to the main branch immediately. Instead of merging the entire feature branch, you want to copy only that single commit to the main branch.  
   - Commands:
     bash
     git checkout main
     git cherry-pick <commit-hash> # Apply the specific commit to main
     

3. Example with Git Rebase:  
   Your feature branch is several commits behind the main branch. Instead of merging main into your branch, you rebase to apply your changes on top of the latest commits on main, creating a cleaner history.
   - Commands:
     bash
     git checkout feature
     git rebase main     # Reapply commits on top of main branch
     

4. Example with Git Revert:  
   A previous commit introduced a bug in the code. You want to remove this commit without deleting it from history.
   - Commands:
     bash
     git revert <commit-hash> # Creates a new commit that undoes the changes
     
Additional Situation-Based Questions

1. Situation: You’re on a team, and each member has been working on their own branches. A teammate accidentally merges an incomplete feature branch into the main branch. How can you undo this without erasing history?
   - Solution: Use `git revert <merge-commit-hash>`. This will create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the feature branch merge while keeping the history intact.

2. Situation: You started working on a new feature branch, but you realize you forgot to branch off the latest version of the main branch. How can you correct this without losing your work?
   - Solution: Use `git rebase main` on your feature branch. This will reapply your commits on top of the latest main branch, as if you had started from the updated branch initially.

3. Situation: Your local branch has uncommitted changes, and you realize you need a quick update from the remote main branch. How do you handle this without committing or discarding your local work?
   - Solution: Use `git stash` to temporarily save your changes. Then, perform `git pull` to update your branch. Finally, use `git stash pop` to reapply your stashed changes after updating.

4. Situation: A specific commit in the development branch has a feature you need in the main branch. However, the development branch also has other unrelated changes. What’s the best way to get that feature commit in the main branch?
   - Solution: Use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` on the main branch to apply only the desired commit from the development branch.

5. Situation: You’re trying to merge a feature branch into the main branch but encounter a lot of conflicts. Some of these conflicts are due to formatting differences, not actual code changes. How can you resolve this?
   - Solution: Manually resolve the conflicts by editing the files, focusing on keeping the necessary logic and removing redundant formatting conflicts. Use `git add <file>` for each resolved file and then `git commit` to complete the merge.

6. Situation: You’ve made several commits locally on your branch but haven’t pushed them yet. Now you realize you need to reorder these commits or squash some of them together for a cleaner history. What should you do?
   - Solution: Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n` (where `n` is the number of recent commits you want to edit). This allows you to reorder, squash, or edit your commits interactively before pushing.

7. Situation: A teammate accidentally pushes sensitive data (like API keys) in a commit. This needs to be removed from the history. How can you do this safely?
   - Solution: You can use `git filter-branch` (or a similar tool like `BFG Repo-Cleaner`) to rewrite history and remove the sensitive data. If the branch is already public, this requires everyone to re-clone the repository afterward.

8. Situation: Your feature branch has been inactive for a while, and the main branch has received several important updates. You want to incorporate these changes but prefer a linear history without a merge commit. How should you proceed?
   - Solution: Use `git rebase main` on your feature branch. This will apply the feature branch’s commits on top of the latest main branch, giving a linear history.

9. Situation: You pushed changes to the wrong branch by mistake. How can you move them to the correct branch and restore the original branch state?
   - Solution: First, create a new branch from the current one using `git branch <new-branch>`. Then switch back to the incorrect branch, reset it to the previous commit (`git reset --hard HEAD~n`), and push with `--force`. Finally, you can continue working in the new branch or merge it to the intended branch.

10. Situation: You’re about to push a commit, but on review, you realize you have an error in one of your previous commits. How can you fix the previous commit without creating a new one?
    - Solution: Make the necessary changes and use `git commit --amend`. This will update the previous commit with your new changes instead of creating a new commit.

Git Webhooks

A Git webhook is a method to notify external services when certain events happen in a Git repository, like when a new commit is pushed or a pull request is created. Webhooks can automate processes, such as triggering CI/CD pipelines, notifying teams, or syncing repositories.



Key Concepts of Git Webhooks

1. Webhook URL: This is the endpoint where the webhook sends the HTTP POST requests. The service receiving the requests (like a CI/CD server) must have a publicly accessible URL to listen for these events.

2. Payload: When a webhook is triggered, Git sends a payload—a JSON object containing data about the event (e.g., commit hash, branch name, files modified). The receiving endpoint uses this payload to understand and process the event.

3. Events: Different events can trigger webhooks. Here are some common events:
   - Push Event: Triggered when someone pushes to the repository.
   - Pull Request Event: Triggered when a pull request is opened, merged, or closed.
   - Tag Push Event: Triggered when a new tag is created.
   - Release Event: Triggered when a release is published.
   - Issue Event: Triggered when issues are created or updated.

4. Secret Key: Many webhooks include a secret key that acts as a security token. The server verifies this secret to ensure that requests are legitimate and coming from the correct source.



How to Set Up a Git Webhook (Example: GitHub)

1. Go to Repository Settings: Navigate to the repository settings and find the "Webhooks" section.
2. Create a New Webhook:
   - Add the Webhook URL (where you want the event data to be sent).
   - Choose the Content Type (usually `application/json`).
   - Optionally, add a Secret for security.
3. Select Events: Choose the events you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Save the Webhook: After setting it up, GitHub will send a test payload to confirm the webhook is set up correctly.



Common Use Cases for Git Webhooks

1. Triggering a CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Use Case: Every time a commit is pushed, the webhook triggers the CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions) to automatically build, test, and deploy the code.
   - How It Works: The webhook payload contains details about the commit and branch. The CI/CD tool uses this data to pull the latest changes, run tests, build artifacts, and deploy if all steps succeed.

2. Deploying to a Server:
   - Use Case: A webhook triggers a deployment script on a production or staging server whenever new code is pushed to the main branch.
   - How It Works: The server’s endpoint listens for push events on the main branch, and upon receiving the webhook payload, it runs a deployment script that pulls the latest code, builds the application, and restarts services.

3. Automated Notifications:
   - Use Case: Send notifications to a team communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams when certain events occur, such as new pull requests or issues being created.
   - How It Works: The webhook is configured to send specific events (e.g., pull request created) to an intermediary service like Zapier, which formats the message and forwards it to the designated Slack channel.

4. Repository Mirroring or Syncing:
   - Use Case: Synchronize changes between two repositories (e.g., GitHub and Bitbucket) using a webhook to initiate the sync process.
   - How It Works: When a push event occurs in the primary repository, the webhook triggers a script or service that pushes the same changes to the mirrored repository.

5. Custom Workflows or Scripts:
   - Use Case: Run a custom script when specific events occur, like cleaning up temporary branches, sending notifications, or updating project management tools.
   - How It Works: The webhook triggers a custom server-side script that performs actions based on the data in the payload.



Example: GitHub Webhook Payload (for Push Event)

Here’s a simplified example of what a GitHub webhook payload might look like for a push event:

json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "before": "9c05d4ab80b0388be1f79e75f9b36a447c430c6e",
  "after": "c1a072329e9fa9db0b7695c0286c0f1f0803df9d",
  "repository": {
    "id": 12345678,
    "name": "example-repo",
    "full_name": "user/example-repo",
    "owner": {
      "name": "user",
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
  },
  "pusher": {
    "name": "user",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "commits": [
    {
      "id": "c1a072329e9fa9db0b7695c0286c0f1f0803df9d",
      "message": "Fixed bug in payment processing",
      "timestamp": "2023-08-10T14:35:22-04:00",
      "author": {
        "name": "user",
        "email": "user@example.com"
      },
      "added": ["file1.txt"],
      "removed": ["file2.txt"],
      "modified": ["file3.txt"]
    }
  ]
}


This payload contains information about:
- Branch Reference (`ref`)
- Commit Information (including the list of added, removed, and modified files)
- Repository Details (name, owner, etc.)
- Pusher Information (who initiated the push)



Best Practices for Using Git Webhooks

1. Use Secrets for Security: Always set up a secret token to verify that webhook requests come from a trusted source.
2. Limit Webhook Events: Choose only the necessary events to reduce unnecessary traffic and avoid triggering redundant actions.
3. Handle Retries: If your server is temporarily down, GitHub or other platforms may retry the webhook. Design your server to handle retries or duplicate events gracefully.
4. Filter Events on the Server: Use logic on the receiving end to process only relevant events (e.g., run a deployment script only for changes to specific branches).
5. Log Webhook Activity: Maintain logs of webhook activity to troubleshoot issues, verify events, and monitor the frequency of events.

By using webhooks effectively, you can automate many parts of your development workflow, increase team productivity, and ensure smoother and faster deployments.

### 1. Git Reset and Fetch

#### Git Reset
`git reset` is used to undo changes in your working directory or repository. It can reset the state of your branch to a specific commit, altering the staging area and optionally the working directory.

Options of `git reset`:
- `--soft`: Resets the commit history but keeps the changes staged.
- `--mixed` (default): Resets the commit history and unstages changes but keeps them in the working directory.
- `--hard`: Resets the commit history and discards changes in both the staging area and working directory.

Example:
Imagine the following commit history:

A -- B -- C (HEAD)


- To move `HEAD` to commit `B` without discarding changes:
  bash
  git reset --soft B
  
  The changes in `C` are staged.

- To unstage changes but keep them in your working directory:
  bash
  git reset --mixed B
  

- To discard all changes in `C` completely:
  bash
  git reset --hard B
  



#### Git Fetch
`git fetch` updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working branch. It retrieves new branches, tags, or commits.

Example:
If your local repository is behind the remote repository:

- Before fetching:
  
  origin/main: A -- B -- C -- D (Remote)
  main: A -- B -- C (Local)
  

- Run:
  bash
  git fetch origin
  
  Your repository now has:
  
  origin/main: A -- B -- C -- D (Remote)
  main: A -- B -- C (Local)
  
  To merge fetched changes into your branch, run `git merge`.



### 2. Upmerge and Downmerge

#### Upmerge
Upmerging refers to merging changes from a lower branch (e.g., feature or bugfix branch) into a higher branch (e.g., develop or main).

Example:
- Branch hierarchy:
  
  feature -> develop -> main
  
- Merge changes from `feature` into `develop`:
  bash
  git checkout develop
  git merge feature
  
  This incorporates `feature` branch changes into `develop`.



#### Downmerge
Downmerging refers to merging changes from a higher branch (e.g., main) into a lower branch (e.g., feature branch). This ensures the lower branch has all updates from the higher branch.

Example:
- Merge changes from `main` into `feature`:
  bash
  git checkout feature
  git merge main
  
  This ensures `feature` is up-to-date with `main`.



### Summary Table

| Command/Term     | Purpose                                              | Example Command                                           |
|-||-|
| `git reset`  | Undo changes in the repo (soft/mixed/hard).          | `git reset --hard HEAD~1`                                |
| `git fetch`  | Retrieve changes from remote without merging.        | `git fetch origin`                                       |
| Upmerge      | Merge changes from a lower branch to a higher branch.| `git merge feature` (while on `develop`)                |
| Downmerge    | Merge changes from a higher branch to a lower branch.| `git merge main` (while on `feature`)                   |
