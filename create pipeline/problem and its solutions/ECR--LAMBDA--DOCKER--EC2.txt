Challenge

we want to create  docker image latest through automation i.e as we push new image it automatically get pushed on ECR [ docker iamge  is pushed  at ECR and ECR is linked with lambda ] and to do this we need create code build --> pipeline and code deploy
 
Problem : 1. during code build it shows error that unable to install Docker and we uanble to create the code build


2. Error while executing command: aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --xxxxxx AWS --password-xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com. Reason: exit status 127


solution : since the docker commands were not working then i checked wheather my ec2 is geting connections from buildspec or not and i was not getting connections thus i revised my code build and i saw that in compute i was selected lambda instead of ec2
