----------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
Create Deployment Scripts in React folder: 
before_install.sh, after_install.sh, start_server.sh, and validate_service.sh.
--------------------------------------------
error : The overall deployment failed because too many individual instances failed deployment, too few healthy instances are available for deployment, or some instances in your deployment group are experiencing problems

error: CodeDeploy agent was not able to receive the lifecycle event. Check the CodeDeploy agent logs on your host and make sure the agent is running and can connect to the CodeDeploy server.

solution: created a script file deploy.sh and configured all things in it and then revise the all things properly by installing codedeploy agent.
