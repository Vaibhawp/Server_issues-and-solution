TCP/IP Model
==============
The TCP/IP model has 4 layers:

Application Layer
----------------------------
Combines functionalities of OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
Handles communication between applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.

Transport Layer
----------------------
Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.
Manages segmentation, error control, and flow control.
Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable).

Internet Layer
--------------------------
Handles logical addressing and routing of data packets.
Ensures data is sent to the correct destination.
Protocols: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP.
Network Access Layer (also called Link Layer)

Combines OSI's Data Link and Physical layers.
Deals with physical hardware and data transmission over the network medium.
Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP.

OSI Model
------------------------
The OSI model has 7 layers:

Application Layer (Layer 7)

find the subnet mask?
find the total no. of n/w can be created 
find the total no. of IP address on each n/w
find the total no. of host on each n/w

a.192.168.10.0/26
 class C:
=>full subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
                                   8      8    8     8  [ n/w =24 and host=8]
Classless Inter-Domain Routing.   [CIDR =26]                 i.e 2 extra taken by host from n/w    n=2

  so the host should have 8 bits generally i.e 2*0,2*1,2*2,2*3,2*4,2*5,2*6,2*7      but two is given by n/w 2*6+2*7=64+128=192
subnet mask is = 255.255.255.192

=>total number of n/w can be created = (2)pow2=4   ==> n=2 number of bits borrowed
=>the total no. of IP address on each n/w ==>(2)pow(8-n)==64
=>total no. of host on each n/w ==>[(2)pow(8-n)] -2 ( 1 for reserve for n/w id and last for brodcast id) ==62 
                                                                                                                                                                                                         
b. 192.168.10.0/28
full subnet mask ==> 255.255.255.0
here n=4 i.e 2*7+2*6+2*5+2*4=240   [ answer will be always less than 150]
First IP Address: Network address (e.g., 10.0.0.0).
Second IP Address: Reserved for the VPC router.
Third IP Address: Reserved for Amazon DNS services.
Fourth IP Address: Reserved for future use by AWS.
Last IP Address: Broadcast address (e.g., 10.0.0.255).
subnet mask= 255.255.255.254
total n/w can be created = 2*4=16
total no. of ip on each n/w =16
total no.of host= 14 

2.find the 5th subnet of 10.0.0.0/8
for host 64
2*n -2 =64  ==>n=6
so 32-6 ==26
first ip ==10.0.0.0/26
second ip==10.0.0.64/26
third ip ==10.0.0.128/26
forth ip ==10.0.0.192/26
fifth ip ==10.0.1.0/26

3.find the 5 th subnet of 
To find the 5th subnet of 10.10.0.0/20 with 3500 hosts, follow these steps:

1. Determine Subnet Size
You need enough host bits to accommodate 3500 hosts.
The formula to find the number of host bits needed is 
2ℎ−2≥3500
2 h −2≥3500, where h is the number of host bits.
2*12=4096
2 *12=4096 (since 
2*11=2048
2 *11 =2048 is not enough).
12 host bits are required.
So, the subnet mask will be 
32−12=20
32−12=20 bits for the network portion.
Subnet Mask: /20 (which is 255.255.240.0).
 Subnet Calculation
Each subnet with /20 provides 4096 IP addresses (including 2 reserved for network and broadcast).
The block size for /20 is 4096 IP addresses.
Find the 5th Subnet
The starting point is 10.10.0.0. Add 4096 IPs for each subsequent subnet:
1st Subnet: 10.10.0.0/20
2nd Subnet: 10.10.16.0/20
3rd Subnet: 10.10.32.0/20
4th Subnet: 10.10.48.0/20
5th Subnet: 10.10.64.0/20
Answer:
The 5th subnet is 10.10.64.0/20.

------------------------------------------------------------------
196.10.0.0/24 host=128
o find the subnet for 196.10.0.0/24 with 128 hosts, follow these steps:

1. Determine the Subnet Size
You need enough host bits to accommodate 128 hosts.
The formula for the number of host bits is 
2ℎ−2≥128
2 h −2≥128, where h is the number of host bits.
2*7=128
2 *7 =128, so 7 host bits are required.
The subnet mask will be 
32−7=25
32−7=25 bits for the network portion.
Subnet Mask: /25 (which is 255.255.255.128).
2. Subnet Calculation
Each subnet with /25 provides 128 IP addresses (126 usable for hosts).
The block size for /25 is 128 IP addresses.
3. Find the Subnets
The starting IP is 196.10.0.0/24.
The first subnet will be 196.10.0.0/25.
Add 128 IPs to the starting point for subsequent subnets.
Subnet List:
1st Subnet: 196.10.0.0/25
2nd Subnet: 196.10.0.128/25
Since you need 128 hosts, a subnet size of /25 works, as each subnet will have 126 usable IP addresses.

Answer:
The subnet mask is /25 for each subnet in the 196.10.0.0/24 network to support 128 hosts.
