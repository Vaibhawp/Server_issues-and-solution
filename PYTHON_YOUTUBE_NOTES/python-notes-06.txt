1.methods [called with object like obj.function()]and constructor[type of method automatically called as object is formed] in oops give its definations and give examples.Inmethods argumnets are used directly without self keyword because it is a part of function but variable inside class are always used with self keyword. and these arguments can be directly given values or the values are passed into the objects of the methods. also explain it by giving examples.
2.How constructor is defined in python def__init__(self): give its two examples
3.What is inheritence in python(minimum two classes are required)and give example for each,multi inheritance is supported in python not in java and php.
4.What is encapsulation [object variables are not accessed directly i.e methods and variables are private)in pyhton(getter and setter) give its 4 examples.including constructor ,without constructor
5How private methods are made in python give its 3 examples
6.What is polymorphism and what is function overloading and function overridding give 6-7 examples so that all concepts of its covered by explaining.
7.Why we use super keyword and how it is used for inheritance and polymorphism
8 What is method overloading and overridding 
9.What are the applications of polymorphism,inheritance give few 
 








DONE TILL LECTURE 56 and make special notes for rental bike question pdf (lecture 57)



===================================================
1Agar kisi class ko inherit kiya hai kisi mei to ushka object bnane ki jarurat nhi hai
2.Har method jo class ke andr bna hai ushme self likhna jaruri hai
3.object class ka bnta hai like obj = classname() aur call humesha method hoga like obj.method()
4.Class aur method banane pe : use krte hai
5.Inheritance mei ek class mei dusre class ko pass krte hai ya to sare class ko ek class mei daal skte hai ya to ek ke andr ek fir ushke age wale ke
6.Kissi argument ko method ke andr print krane ke liye    =====> self.argumnet=value/argument===> now obj.method(value of argument)////////////////////////////see example oops_3.py
7. Private variables are made by __variable and they cannot accessed directly with object thus we always use constructor or in methods we use setter and getter
8.In polymorphism function is same but argumnets are different
9.Method overloading one function but called many times for different values see oops_4.py and in method overridding two methods and same parameter and inherit a in b then here overriding is done to save memory oops_5.py
